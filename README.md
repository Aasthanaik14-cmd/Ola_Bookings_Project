> This project analyzes Ola ride bookings using SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis. The SQL queries uncover key insights such as ride volumes, peak booking hours, cancellation trends, customer behavior, payment preferences, and vehicle-type performance.
> Power BI is then used to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes these insights through KPIs, charts, slicers, and trend analyses. The reports provide a clear understanding of ride patterns and operational metrics.
> This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills, including:
-Data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation using SQL
-Building visual dashboards in Power BI
-Applying DAX measures for calculations
-Translating raw data into meaningful business insights
